PCM
相变随机存取存储器（PCRAM、PRAM或PCM）是目前研究中最成熟的新存储技术。它依赖于存在于两种不同性质的相变材料：高电阻率的非晶相和低电阻率的结晶相。PCRAM具有良好的可扩展性和耐用性，可与nandflash媲美，这使得它成为未来高速存储设备的有力候选。这项技术比DRAM慢（速度在5到15倍之间），由于其重置操作比其他操作消耗的能量更大，因此在能耗方面存在很大差距
Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM, PRAM or PCM) is currently the most mature of the new memory technologies under research. It relies on phase-change materials that exist in two different phases with distinct properties: an amorphous phase, with high electrical resistivity, and a crystalline phase, with low electrical resistivity. PCRAM scales well and presents endurance comparable to that of NAND Flash, which makes it a strong candidate for future high-speed storage devices. This technology is slower than DRAM (between 5 and 15 times slower) and has a considerable disparity in energy consumption due to its RESET operation dissipating a larger amount of energy than other operations
 
What is PCM
?	The phase-change memory is an emerging nonvolatile semiconductor technology base on thermally induced phase transitions of a thin-film chalcogenide material.
?	PCM device is a resistor of chalcogenide material, usually  a Ge-Sb-Te (GST) alloy.
?	The resistance of PCM changes in two states: Crystalline or Amorphous
?	Phase transitions can be obtained by applying voltage pulses with different amplitudes and with duration in the range of tenths of nanoseconds.
